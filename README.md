# Dapp Swap - Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange

Dapp Swap is the first of two DEX websites used for purposes of simulating three (3) unique cryptocurrencies created with the deployment of the standardized AMM smart contract. Dapp Swapp allows for all of the basic features of a decentralized exchange including swaps, deposits, and withdrawals.

Three unique liquidity pool addresses are attributed to Dapp Swap, allowing for specific exchange rates to be set and then tested for using the Turbo Shell DEX Aggregator.
